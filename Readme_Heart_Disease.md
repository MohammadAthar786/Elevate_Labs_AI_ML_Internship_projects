🗓️ Work Summary – 30 June 2025
✅ Heart Disease Prediction Project
Today, I worked on a Heart Disease Prediction project using a Random Forest Classifier. Key tasks completed:

Loaded and preprocessed the dataset (heart.csv).

Split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split().

Trained a RandomForestClassifier with random_state=42 for reproducibility.

Evaluated the model using:

Accuracy score on both training and testing datasets.

Confusion Matrix visualized using seaborn.heatmap.

Verified model performance and interpreted results.

Committed the Jupyter Notebook and dataset to the GitHub repository.

📁 Files Added
HeartDiseasePrediction.ipynb – main notebook for training and evaluation.

heart.csv – dataset used for model training and testing.
